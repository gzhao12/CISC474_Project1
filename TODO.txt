TODO:
  front end:
    center the app (tiles and stuff)
    change font in the box
    make the boxes touching?
  back end:
    redo isClicked because it doesn't work when you click on multiple blank tiles or when you click multiple full tiles or in a lot of other situations
    do we need to add an array containing "" or can we just check if NULL?
    make it work
